# 🧠 Classification Algorithm Comparison  
### **Decision Tree vs Random Forest**

This project compares the performance of two popular machine learning classifiers  
— **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** — on two different real-world datasets.

It was completed as part of a **Data Mining Lab Assignment** for M.Tech Semester 1.

## 📘 **Datasets Used**

### **1️⃣ Wine Quality Dataset (Multi-Class Classification)**
- Predict wine quality scores (3 to 8)
- Contains chemical properties like acidity, alcohol, density, etc.

### **2️⃣ Credit Card Default Dataset (Binary Classification)**
- Predict whether a customer will default next month
- Contains billing history, payment patterns, and demographic info

## 🧪 **Algorithms Compared**

### **1. Decision Tree Classifier**
A simple and interpretable model that splits data based on feature values.
- Easy to visualize  
- Prone to overfitting  
- Works well for small/clean datasets  

### **2. Random Forest Classifier**
An ensemble of multiple decision trees.
- More accurate  
- Reduces overfitting  
- Handles large, noisy datasets well  

Random Forest was selected as **Classifier 2** for advanced comparison.
